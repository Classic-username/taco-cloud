!!!!----THIS WILL BE THE LAST BRANCH MERGED TO THE MAIN REPO----!!!!
The book is starting to h e a v i l y diverge from being able to have a coherent project structure, and is refactoring things seemingly willy nilly.
Assuming I follow the book and continue merging, I will lose previous work examples, so for the sake of keeping the examples, I will be saving each thing to its own branch and not merging into main.


Important message to copy:
Check Readme for Accessing the H2 database
